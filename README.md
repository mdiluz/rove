Rove
====

Rove is an asynchronous nomadic game about exploring as part of a loose community.

This repository is a [living document](https://github.com/mdiluz/rove/tree/master/docs) of current game design, as well as source code for the `rove-server` deployment and the `rove` command line client.

See [api.go](https://github.com/mdiluz/rove/blob/master/pkg/rove/api.go) for the current server-client API.
