Proof Of Concept
================

For a proof of concept we'll implement a very small subset of the final features

### Core Features

* Create an account (done)
* Control an rover in a 2D map (done)
* Query for what the rover can see (done)
* Persistent accounts and world (done)
* Multiple users (done)
* Populate map with locations/objects
* Commands happen in "real time"

### Stretch goals

* Rover inventory
* Rover internals
* Basic time mechanics
* Basic survival mechanics

### Key missing features

* No token security (very hackable)
* No time dilation effects
* No global coordinates
* No render of rover camera view
* No rover replacement mechanic
* No advanced app/interface
