Proof Of Concept
================

For a proof of concept we'll implement a very small subset of the final features

### Core Features

* Create an account
* Control an entity in a 2D map
* Query for what the entity can see
* Persistent accounts and world
* Multiple users

### Stretch goals

* Rover inventory
* Rover internals
* Basic time mechanics
* Basic survival mechanics

### Key missing features

* No token security (very hackable)
* No time dilation effects
* No global coordinates
* No render of rover camera view
* No rover replacement mechanic
* No advanced app/interface
